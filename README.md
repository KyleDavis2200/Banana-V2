Plastic Antweight Torque Walker Combat Robot

## Background

For Hack Club's Undercity Hackathon, my group chose to make a torque walker combat robot. These robots get a weight bonus because instead of using wheels, they walk by spinning each weapon up and down to create a torque that advances each side of the robot forwards. This allows the size of the weapon to be maximized while maintaining some mobility. My goal for this version of the robot is to use the full weight allowance, as our previous design was horribly underweight due to not having the time to print larger parts or the motors to power a larger robot. This version of the project starts the CAD completely from scratch and does not use any of the same electronics as the first version. The only thing that is carried over from the initial design is the concept.
