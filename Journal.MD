The basic concept of this robot is a torque walker robot, which uses the torque created from spinning each weapon up and down to walk the robot forwards. This grants the robot a weight bonus, allowing it to use bigger weapons. This robot is designed around a Repeat Dual ESC, two Repeat 2822 Motors, and a 4S 300mah battery. For the switch, I will be using a Fingertech switch.

Started the CAD design of the robot. I had 7 inch blades tilted at a 20 degree angle for this design, but I may opt to decrease the angle.  I am also looking into adding feet to the robot after seeing them implemented on similar robots.

My first priority today was ballooning out the middle of the robot to create more space for electronics. This was a change we had to make at Undercity because our initial design did not have enough space for all of the electronics to fit. This was accomplished through a few sketches and a loft. The downside of this is that it caused the shell feature to fail when leaving more than a 2.5mm shell, which led to hollowing out the insides of the robot taking much longer than I expected.

Next, I created a bottom plate that included feet, which should allow the robot to walk better.

The first thing I did today was add mounting holes for the weapon motors into the frame.

Next, I designed a weapon blade that the motor would fit inside of. This motor also allows me to use mounting screws to hold the blade on, which should solve some of the issues we experienced with the blades coming off at Undercity.

After this, I created a spine to help the robot self right, which was one of the major issues we had with it at Undercity.
