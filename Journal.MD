Started the CAD design of the robot. I had 7 inch blades tilted at a 20 degree angle for this design, but I may opt to decrease the angle.  I am also looking into adding feet to the robot after seeing them implemented on similar robots.

The first thing I did today was add mounting holes for the weapon motors into the frame.

Next, I designed a weapon blade that the motor would fit inside of. This motor also allows me to use mounting screws to hold the blade on, which should solve some of the issues we experienced with the blades comingoff at Undercity.
